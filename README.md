Synchronize activities with GarminConnect and download EPO file (Extended Prediction Orbit) on Linux. I'm using Fenix 2 and so far it's the only watch this application was tested with.

## Note about passwords
At first run, the application will ask for GarminConnect login and password which then will be stored in `~/.garmin-sync`. This file is **NOT encrypted**, it's only a bit obfuscated so it's harder to read it from behind of your shoulter.
